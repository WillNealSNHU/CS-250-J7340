How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The best way to interpret user needs in my opinion is to be a user. Physically get into the software, play around with it and understand what it is the stakeholder and end user is needing. User stories help because you have gathered information from the stakeholder, their needs and wants. You have already touched the software and have a good idea of what the key features are that need to be implemented. Now its just time to write it down, add acceptance criteria and make sure the team is on the same page.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 

I approach them with a good overall idea of what is being built. I understand the scope of the project and what the stakeholder and end user is asking for. Where agile comes into play is sometime those plans change. Maybe they want the design to incorporate something that was not originally talked about. This is fine, projects scale and adapt. So do developers. We need to be able to pivot user needs and stakeholders wants. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

First and foremost it means having a servant leader attitude. It doesn’t matter if I am a developer. There will be new hires that might need help setting up their environment or maybe someone has lost the link to an important confluence page that has amazing documentation on an API we consume and it’d really help that person out. Maybe the PO isn’t fully understanding a couple items in the backlog. How can I be of help to my team. Getting my own work done is a given, making sure I hit sprint goals is just what the job is, being able to give back and being someone people can go to is going above and beyond. Too many times in a code review we see people having inflated or deflated egos. A good team member would say “hey this code looks really good. I like how you did XYZ, however; I think it makes more sense if we refactor this to incorporate FGH”. There’s a way of effectively communicating with your team that allows them to be lifted up and not forced down.
